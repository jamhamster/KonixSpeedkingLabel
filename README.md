These labels have a 1mm excess around the edges and inside. This is to make it easier to cut out. 

Suggested method:

Use Glossy Vinyl Self-Adhesive labels, print in best quality

Once printed, leave to completely dry for 24 hours. 

Spray with Clear Lacquer, a light covering at first, then a second, thicker coat about 10 minutes later. Leave to dry for 24 hours.

Cut out with scissors, or a craft knife, and apply.



Second cutting method using a laser:

You can use the image to create a mask for a laser cutter - This is not really recommended as the Vinyl labels shoudl not be used on a laser cuter but I used one as I have plenty of ventilation.

Trace the image in Lightburn

Undersize it by 1mm all round, including the joystick hole. 

Cut an outline on the laser onto a spare scrap of card aligned to the top left of the laser. 

Use this as a guide to ensure that ther label is centered. 

Enjoy your shiny new label! :-)
